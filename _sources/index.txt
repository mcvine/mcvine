MCViNE: Monte Carlo VItual Neutron Experiment
=============================================

MCViNE is 
a versatile Monte Carlo neutron ray-tracing program 
that provides researchers with tools for performing 
computer modeling and simulations that mirror real 
neutron scattering experiments. 

Currently MCViNE software is only available for the Linux platform,
which was selected because other tools for scientific computing, including
molecular dynamics and ab initio simulations, use this platform.
Detailed installation instructions for MCViNE are available at
:ref:`Installation <installation>`.
Building the source is driven by a python script, but the underlying
build engine is based on gnu make.

.. usages of instrument simulation applications, 

The MCViNE :ref:`user documentation <mcvinedocs>` includes
:ref:`explanations of MCViNE concepts <philosophy>`,
:ref:`tutorials <tutorials>`, 
:ref:`usage of neutron components <Components>`,
and
:ref:`instructions for creating a sample assembly <SampleAssembly>`.

At this point, MCViNE is under the git version control system,
and MCViNE source code is available for online-browsing at 
`the github site <https://github.com/heetuu/MCViNE>`_.

MCViNE is currently deployed on the analysis computing clusters at the
Spallation Neutron Source (SNS).
Any SNS user can use MCViNE at analysis.sns.gov after running an
environment setup script.

There are many functionalities available in the MCViNE package, 
so novice users may find it difficult to navigate through the user
documentation and learn how to perform MCViNE simulations for their needs.
To make MCViNE more readily accessible to non-expert users,
we are experimenting with 
:ref:`workflow templates <workflows>`.
Users can easily clone workflows from the templates
and customize them by modifying sample specification and simulation
parameters.
Output of a workflow usually includes 
the simulated scattered neutrons,
the simulated event-mode NeXus file,
and the reduced I(Q, E) file.

The MCViNE software is an open source software and is freely
available.

Feedback to the MCViNE developers can be provided through the
