Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

How do I ...
------------

... Use a mcstas component that I wrote myself?
    An automatic tools is available to wrap a mcstas component to a mcvine component.
    Please take a look at :ref:`user-defined-mcstas-components`.

... Check whether parallel mcvine simulation is available for my system?
    Run the following command::

      $ mpirun -np 2 python -c "import mpi; print mpi.world().rank"

    If you see two number "0" and "1" (random sequence), parallel mcvine is available.

... Get help on the instrument simulation application I have created?
    Say if your application is mysimapp.py, you can do::

      $ mysimapp.py -h

    to see what this app is about, and the available options. 
    For help on common simulation application options, please refer 
    to :ref:`fundamentals-instrument`; for a tutorial, see
    :ref:`create-sim-app`.

... Rescue my instrument simulations?
    Sometimes SEQ beam simulation may fail or stall, especially if the number of MC count is large.
    In that case, you can rescue the simulation results by

    1. Killing the process if necessary
    2. Merge simulated neutrons::
     
       $ cd /path/to/sim/_m2sout
       $ python -c "from mcni.neutron_storage import merge_and_normalize as man; man('neutrons', '.')"
	 
    3. Merge monitor outputs::
   
       $ python -c "from mcni.components.HistogramBasedMonitorMixin import merge_and_normalize as man; man('IE.h5', '.'); man('mon1-tof.h5', '.'); man('mon2-tof.h5', '.') "
    
    4. Run post-processing script (assume Ei=100. please change accordingly)::
   
       $ cd /path/to/sim/
       $ python -c "from mcvine.instruments.SEQUOIA import beam_postprocessing as bpp; bpp.run('./_m2sout', './out', 100.)"


Why do I...
-----------

... get nothing from my simulation?
    You may want to check if your configuration is done correctly.
    A good thing to check is if the components are assign correctly::
    
      $ mysimapp.py --help-persistence
      
    It prints out looking-up of all components (not only neutron components, but also
    other components that help make the simulation application possible,
    such as geometer). 
    You may see hints of why some components are not really loaded successfully.

... get MemoryError?
    You may need to reduce buffer_size. It determines how many neutrons are
    kept in the memory. To set buffer_size to, say, one million neutrons, do::
      
      --buffer_size=1000000

    (Most simulation applications accept this option, but some workflow scripts
    do not accept this option.)
    Optimal buffer_size depends on the memory for the computing nodes.
    For a machine of 1G memory, the maximum buffer_size would be
    1e9/100 = 1e7 neutrons if only one processor is used.
    If, however, you are running parallely on a machine of 10 cpus and 2G
    ram, the maximum buffer_size would be 2e9/100/10 = 2e6.
    It also depends on factors such as
    whether the option "multiple-scattering" is turned on.
    If "multiple-scattering" is on, it is safer to divide the number 
    you got by another factor of 10.
    If you are running a MCViNE workflow, sometimes it could be more convenient to
    use environment variable to set the maximum neutron buffer size like
    this::
      
      MCVINE_MAX_NEUTRON_BUFFER_SIZE=100000
