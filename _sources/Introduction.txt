Introduction
==============

To put it simply, MCViNE is a Monte Carlo simulation framework 
useful for simulating neutron experiments. 

1. MCViNE is a framework to construct simulated neutron instruments, and manage the flow of neutrons through them from moderator to detector.
2. It also provides a mechanism to allow users to assemble a complex sample component (including sample and also the sample environment, eg. sample holder). This mechanism is extensible to handle arbitrary complex geometeric shapes of neutron scatterer, and arbitrary complex physics of neutron scattering.

A natural question to ask is, how is it different from existing legacy Monte Carlo
neutron scattering code such as mcstas, vitess, etc?
Please take a moment to read :ref:`philosophy of MCViNE <philosophy>`.

.. Example usages
.. --------------

.. MCViNE framework is very flexible and powerful and can take on a variety of
.. simulation problems. Here are just some simple examples:

.. 1. can simulate complex sample with scattering of various origins (phonon scattering and magnetic scattering, etc)
.. 2. can simulate accurately a real, complex detector system such as that of the ARCS instrument at SNS
