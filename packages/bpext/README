This package was moved from [danse-inelastic bpext](https://github.com/danse-inelastic/bpext), adjusted, modernized (e.g. journal referenced removed) and added as a mcvine-core package (packages/bpext). 
It is installed like the other components of the packages/ directory, e.g. mccomponents, in which C header files, python, shared library objects, etc. are built and placed in locations based on the rest of the components.

The package helps developers to build interconnection codes for 
connecting boost python bindings to other types of bindings through PyCObject.

The main usage of this package are contained in two methods:

 - extract_ptr: extract a pointer from a boost python object and return a PyCObject 
   of that pointer.

 - wrap_ptr: extract the raw pointer inside a PyCObject and wrap it in a boost python
   object; return the boost python object.

 - wrap_native_ptr: extract the void pointer inside a PyCObject and put it in
   a simple WrappedPointer object and then wrap that object in a boost python 
   object; return the boost python object. This is a workaround for wrap_ptr
   not handling native pointers.

For developers:

  To extend this package to support more c++ classes, you will need
  to register new converters. Please read module/register_converters.*
  for an example. The basic syntax is:

    extractorRegistry[type_name] = extract_ptr< type >;
    wrapperRegistry[type_name] = wrap_ptr< type >;
