    This cross section is per unit cell.
    
    According to Squires, cross section by one Debye Scherrer cone is
    \sigma_{\tau} = 1/v_0 \lambda^3/(4sin(\theta/2)) \sum_{all \tau\prime of same length} |F_N(\tau\prime)|^2

    The total cross section is the sum of all such cones
    (number of cones is limited by Ei)
    
    Limitation: 
     * the diffraction peaks list usually could be limited
       if they are loaded from a file such as laz.
       Probably better be computed directly from the structure.
       When the peaks list is limited, the calculation
       would be wrong when Ei gets larger 
       (should see more diff peaks but they are not counted).
     * only  consider the ideal powder diffraction without
       vibrations.
