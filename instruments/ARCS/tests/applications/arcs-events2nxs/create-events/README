The simulation here sends neutrons to arcs detector system.

The neutrons were simulated from an artificial sample 
that scatters only to one particular angle (on a cone).
The neutrons were saved in the file "scattered-neutrons-example".
That simulation was done with incident energy 700meV.
The sample was a "resolution sample", which only scatters neutrons
to Q = 10 angstrom**-1 and E = 100 meV.

The detector system is specified by ARCS.xml. Please note 
that this ARCS.xml is different from the one in 
mcvine-resources/instruments/ARCS/ARCS.xml.
The reason is the nexus "processed" file for ARCS has a different
convention of counting pixels than the original counting scheme
defined by Rick's data acquisition team.
This file is the same as mcvine-resources/instruments/ARCS/ARCS.xml.fornxs

To run this simulation, run command "run".
